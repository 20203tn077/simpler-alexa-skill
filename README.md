# Simpler Alexa Skill

A simplified version of an Alexa skill, split in different layers for a better separation of concerns.
Includes a persistance abstraction service using DynamoDB and an example repository that implements it.
The skill also uses a variety of util functions that makes declaring handlers and getting handler input data easier.
